### How it's built
The frontend was built with Webflow and TypeForm and the backend with [Redis](https://redislabs.com/), [PassNinja](https://passninja.com/), and NodeJs.

### Setting up the backend
If you're new to building web applications you may have trouble following this guide. It's meant for those with medium to advanced experience since we're using a serverless backend built on AWS.
